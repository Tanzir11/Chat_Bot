# NLP Question Classifier

This project demonstrates a simple question classifier using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The classifier is trained on a dataset of questions and their corresponding subtopics.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Tanzir11/Chat_Bot.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Chat_Bot`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset:
   - Create an Excel file named `output.xlsx` containing the questions and their subtopics.
   - Ensure that the questions are stored in the "Question" column and the corresponding subtopics are in the "Subtopic" column.
2. Run the script: `python question_classifier.py`
3. Interact with the bot:
   - Enter your questions when prompted by the "User: " input.
   - The bot will classify the questions into subtopics and provide a confidence score for the prediction.
   - You can end the conversation by entering one of the predefined conversation enders.
